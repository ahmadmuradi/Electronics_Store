   ```bash
   npm uninstall electron
   npm install electron@latest --save-dev
   ```

2. **Alternative: Use a different Electron version:**

   ```bash
   npm install electron@22.3.27 --save-dev
   ```

3. **Clear npm cache:**

   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   npm install
   ```

4. **If still having issues, try:**

   ```bash
   npx create-electron-app test-app
   # Then copy our files to the working electron app
   ```
