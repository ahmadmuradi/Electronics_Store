# Build Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. CLI App Version Source Warning
**Issue**: `The field "cli.appVersionSource" is not set, but it will be required in the future`

**Fix**: Added `"appVersionSource": "remote"` to `eas.json` under the `cli` section.
- This allows EAS to manage app versions automatically
- Resolves the future compatibility warning

### 2. Android Build Configuration
**Issue**: Gradle build failed due to incomplete app configuration

**Fixes Applied**:
- Updated `app.json` with proper Android configuration:
  - Added `android.package` matching the build.gradle applicationId
  - Added `android.versionCode` for proper version management
  - Added platform-specific configurations for iOS and Android
  - Removed references to missing asset files to prevent build errors

- Enhanced `eas.json` build profiles:
  - Added Android configuration to development profile
  - Ensured consistent build settings across all profiles
  - Maintained APK build type for better compatibility

## Files Modified

1. **eas.json**
   - Added `cli.appVersionSource: "remote"`
   - Enhanced build profiles with consistent Android configurations

2. **app.json**
   - Added comprehensive platform configurations
   - Specified Android package name and version code
   - Removed references to missing asset files

## Next Steps

1. **Test the build**: Run `eas build --platform android --profile preview` to test the fixes
2. **Add assets** (optional): Create proper app icons and splash screens when ready
3. **Monitor build logs**: Check the EAS build logs for any remaining issues

## Build Commands

```bash
# Preview build (recommended for testing)
eas build --platform android --profile preview

# Production build
eas build --platform android --profile production

# Development build
eas build --platform android --profile development
```

## Verification

The following issues should now be resolved:
- ✅ CLI app version source warning eliminated
- ✅ Android package configuration properly set
- ✅ Build profiles configured consistently
- ✅ Missing asset references removed to prevent build failures
