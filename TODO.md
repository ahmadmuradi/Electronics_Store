# Electronics Store App Development TODO

## Phase 4: Develop Backend API (Completed)
- [x] Set up FastAPI project with SQLAlchemy models, Pydantic schemas, and database (SQLite).
- [x] Implement CRUD endpoints for Products, Suppliers, Categories, Customers.
- [x] Implement sales creation with stock updates and inventory transactions.
- [x] Implement purchase orders and inventory transaction viewing.
- [x] Create main.py with all endpoints and error handling.

## Phase 5: Develop Desktop Application (Electron)
- [x] Create project directory: electronics-store-app/desktop/electron-inventory-app/
- [x] Create package.json with Electron dependency and start script.
- [x] Create main.js for window setup (1200x800, load index.html).
- [x] Create index.html with basic structure (title, inventory div, CSS/JS links).
- [x] Create styles.css with basic styling.
- [x] Create renderer.js with fetch to backend API (/products) and display inventory (name, SKU, stock).
- [x] Install dependencies: cd electronics-store-app/desktop/electron-inventory-app && npm install
- [x] Test: Run backend (uvicorn main:app --reload in backend/), then npm start in desktop/ to verify window opens and displays inventory.
- [x] Integrate additional features: Add forms for adding/editing products, sales processing via API.

## Phase 6: Develop Mobile Application (React Native)
- [x] Set up React Native project structure with navigation (ProductList, Detail, StockUpdate screens).
- [x] Implement screens with mock data and API integration (fetch products, update stock).
- [x] Add offline caching and sync (using AsyncStorage or similar).
- [x] Test on emulators/devices.

## Phase 7: Testing and Deployment
- [x] Unit/Integration tests for backend (pytest).
- [x] Manual/UAT for desktop and mobile.
- [ ] Deploy backend (Docker/AWS), package desktop (electron-builder), submit mobile to stores.
- [x] Full system testing: End-to-end workflows (sale reduces stock, visible in both apps).

Last Updated: Backend API implemented.
